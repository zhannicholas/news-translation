Many of us use  `git`  on a daily basis. But how many of us know what goes on under the hood?

For example, what happens when we use  `git commit`? What is stored between commits? Is it just a diff between the current and previous commit? If so, how is the diff encoded? Or is an entire snapshot of the repo stored each time? What really happens when we use  `git init`  ?

Many people who use  `git`  don’t know the answers to the questions above. But does it really matter?

First, as professionals, we should strive to understand the tools we use, especially if we use them all the time — like  `git`  .

But even more acutely, I've found that understanding how git actually works is useful in many scenarios — whether it’s resolving merge conflicts, looking to conduct an interesting rebase, or even just when something goes slightly wrong.

You’ll benefit from this post if you’re experienced enough with  `git`  to feel comfortable with commands such as  `git pull`  ,`git push`  ,`git add`  or  `git commit`.

Still, we will start with an overview to make sure we are on the same page regarding the mechanisms of  `git`, and specifically, the terms used throughout this post.

I also uploaded a YouTube series covering this post — you are welcome to watch it  [here][1].

# What to expect from this tutorial

We will get a rare understanding of what goes on under the hood of what we do almost daily.

We will start by covering objects — **blobs, trees,** and  **commits.**  We will then briefly discuss  **branches** and how they are implemented. We will dive into the  **working directory, staging area** and  **repository**.

And we will make sure we understand how these terms relate to the  `git`  commands we know and use to create a new repository.

Next, will create a repository from scratch — without using  `git init`,  `git add`, or  `git commit`. This will allow us to  **deepen our understanding of what is happening under the hood**  when we work with  `git`.

We will also create new branches, switch branches, and create additional commits — all without using  `git branch`  or  `git checkout`.

By the end of this post,  **you will feel like you  _understand_** `**git**`. Are you up for it? 😎

# Git Objects — blob, tree and commit

It is very useful to think about  `git`  as maintaining a file system, and specifically — snapshots of that system in time.

A file system begins with a  _root directory_ (in UNIX-based systems,  `/`), which usually contains other directories (for example,  `/usr`  or  `/bin`). These directories contain other directories, and/or files (for example,  `/usr/1.txt`).

In  `git`, the contents of files are stored in objects called  **blobs**, binary large objects.

The difference between  **blobs**  and files is that files also contain meta-data. For example, a file “remembers” when it was created, so if you move that file into another directory, its creation time remains the same.

**Blobs**, on the other hand, are just contents — binary streams of data. A  **blob** doesn’t register its creation date, its name, or anything but its contents.

Every  **blob**  in  `git`  is identified by its  [SHA-1 hash][2]. SHA-1 hashes consist of 20 bytes, usually represented by 40 characters in hexadecimal form. Throughout this post we will sometimes show just the first characters of that hash.

![Blobs have SHA-1 hashes associated with them](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-34.png)

In  `git`, the equivalent of a directory is a  **tree**. A  **tree** is basically a directory listing, referring to  **blobs**  as well as other  **trees**.

**Trees**  are identified by their SHA-1 hashes as well. Referring to these objects, either  **blobs**  or other  **trees**, happens via the SHA-1 hash of the objects.

![A tree is a directory listing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-35.png)

Note that the  **tree**  **CAFE7** refers to the  **blob F92A0**  as  _pic.png._ In another  **tree**, that same  **blob** may have another name.

![A tree may contain sub-trees, as well as blobs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-36.png)

The diagram above is equivalent to a file system with a root directory that has one file at  `/test.js`, and a directory named  `/docs`  with two files:  `/docs/pic.png`  and  `/docs/1.txt`.

Now it’s time to take a snapshot of that file system — and store all the files that existed at that time, along with their contents.

In  `git`, a snapshot is a  **commit**. A  **commit**  object includes a pointer to the main  **tree**  (the root directory), as well as other meta-data such as the  **committer**, a  **commit**  message and the  **commit**  time.

In most cases, a  **commit**  also has one or more parent  **commits** — the previous snapshot(s). Of course,  **commit**  objects are also identified by their SHA-1 hashes. These are the hashes we are used to seeing when we use  `git log`.

![A commit is a snapshot in time. It refers to the root tree. As this is the first commit, it has no parent(s).](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-37.png)

Every  **commit** holds the  _entire snapshot_, not just diffs from the previous  **commit(s)**.

How can that work? Doesn’t that mean that we have to store a lot of data every commit?

Let’s examine what happens if we change the contents of a file. Say that we edit  `1.txt`, and add an exclamation mark — that is, we changed the content from  `HELLO WORLD`, to  `HELLO WORLD!`.

Well, this change would mean that we have a new  **blob,** with a new SHA-1 hash. This makes sense, as  `sha1("HELLO WORLD")`  is different from  `sha1("HELLO WORLD!")`.

![Changing the blob results in a new SHA-1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-38.png)

Since we have a new hash, then the  **tree**’s listing should also change. After all, our  **tree** no longer points to  **blob 73D8A**, but rather  **blob 62E7A**  instead. As we change the  **tree**’s contents, we also change its hash.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-39.png)

The tree that points to the changed blob needs to change as well

And now, since the hash of that  ****tree**** is different, we also need to change the parent  ****tree ****— as the latter no longer points to  ****tree CAFE7****, but rather  ****tree 24601****.  Consequently, the  ****parent****  ****tree**** will also have a new hash.

![The root tree also changes, and so does its hash.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-40.png)

Almost ready to create a new  **commit**  object, and it seems like we are going to store a lot of data — the entire file system, once more! But is that really necessary?

Actually, some objects, specifically  **blob**  objects, haven’t changed since the previous commit — **blob F92A0** remained intact, and so did  **blob F00D1.**

So this is the trick — as long as an object doesn’t change, we don’t store it again. In this case, we don’t need to store  **blob F92A0** and **blob F00D1** once more.  We only refer to them by their hash values. We can then create our  **commit** object.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-41.png)

Blobs that remained intact are referenced by their hash values

Since this  **commit**  is not the first  **commit**, it has a parent — **commit A1337**.

#### So to recap, we introduced three git objects:

-   **blob — **contents of a file.
-   **tree **— a directory listing (of  **blobs**  and  **trees**).
-   **commit **— a snapshot of the working tree.

Let us consider the hashes of these objects for a bit. Let’s say I wrote the string  `git is awesome!`  and created a  **blob** from it. You did the same on your system. Would we have the same hash?

The answer is — Yes. Since the  **blobs**  consist of the same data, they’ll have the same SHA-1 values.

What if I made a  **tree** that references the  **blob** of  `git is awesome!`, and gave it a specific name and metadata, and you did exactly the same on your system. Would we have the same hash?

Again, yes. Since the  **trees** objects are the same, they would have the same hash.

What if I created a  **commit**  of that  **tree** with the commit message  `Hello`, and you did the same on your system. Would we have the same hash?

In this case, the answer is — No. Even though our  **commit** objects refer to the same  **tree**, they have different  **commit** details — time, committer etc.

# Branches in Git

**A branch is just a named reference to a commit**.

We could always reference a  **commit** by its SHA-1 hash, but humans usually prefer other forms to name objects. A  **branch**  is one way to reference a  **commit**, but it’s really just that.

In most repositories, the main line of development is done in a branch called  `master`. This is just a name, and it’s created when we use  `git init`, making it is widely used. However, it’s by no means special, and we could use any other name we’d like.

Typically, the branch points to the latest  **commit**  in the line of development we are currently working on.

![A branch is just a named reference to a commit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-42.png)

To create another branch, we usually use the  `git branch`  command. By doing that, we actually create another pointer. So if we create a branch called  `test`, by using  `git branch test`, we are actually creating another pointer that points to the same  **commit** as the branch we are currently on.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-43.png)

Using \`git branch\` creates another pointer

How does  `git`  know what branch we’re currently on? It keeps a special pointer called  `HEAD`. Usually,  `HEAD`  points to a branch, which in turns points to a  **commit**. In some cases,  `HEAD`  can also point to a  **commit**  directly, but we won’t focus on that.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-44.png)

HEAD points to the branch we are currently on.

To switch the active branch to be  `test`, we can use the command  `git checkout test`. Now we can already guess what this command actually does — it just changes  `HEAD`  to point to  `test`.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-45.png)

\`git checkout test\` changes where \`HEAD\` points

We could also use  `git checkout -b test`  before creating the  `test`  branch, which is the equivalent of running  `git branch test`  to create the branch, and then  `git checkout test`  to move  `HEAD`  to point to the new branch.

What happens if we make some changes and create a new  **commit** using  `git commit`? Which branch will the new  **commit** be added to?

The answer is the  `test`  branch, as this is the active branch (since  `HEAD`  points to it). Afterwards, the  `test`  pointer will move to the newly added  **commit**. Note that  `HEAD`  still points to  `test`.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-46.png)

Every time we use \`git commit\`, the branch pointer moves to the newly created commit.

So if we go back to master by  `git checkout master`, we move  `HEAD`  to point to  `master`  again.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-47.png)

Now, if we create another  **commit**, it will be added to the  `master`  branch (and its parent would be  **commit B2424**).

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-48.png)

# How to Record Changes in Git

Usually, when we work on our source code we work from a  **working dir**. A  **working dir(ectrory)** (or  **working tree**)  is any directory on our file system which has a  **repository** associated with it. It contains the folders and files of our project, and also a directory called  `.git`  that we will talk more about later.

After we make some changes, we want to record them in our  **repository**. A  **repository**  (in short:  **repo**) is a collection of  **commits**, each of which is an archive of what the project’s  **working tree** looked like at a past date, whether on our machine or someone else’s.

A  **repository** also includes things other than our code files, such as  `HEAD`, branches, and so on.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-49.png)

Unlike other, similar tools you may have used,  `git`  does not commit changes from the  **working tree** directly into the  **repository**. Instead, changes are first registered in something called the  **index**, or the  **staging area**.

Both of these terms refer to the same thing, and they are used often in  `git`’s documentation. We will use these terms interchangeably throughout this post.

When we  `checkout`  a branch,  `git`  populates the  **index** with all the file contents that were last checked out into our  **working directory** and what they looked like when they were originally checked out. When we use  `git commit`, the  **commit** is created based on the state of the  **index**.

The use of the  **index**  allows us to carefully prepare each  **commit**. For example, we may have two files with changes since our last  **commit**  in our  **working dir**. We may only add one of them to the  **index** (using  `git add`), and then use  `git commit`  to record this change only.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-50.png)

Files in our  **working directory** can be in one of two states:  **tracked**  or  **untracked**.

**Tracked files** are files that  `git`  knows about. They either were in the last snapshot (**commit**), or they are  **staged** now (that is, they are in the  **staging area**).

**Untracked files** are everything else — any files in our **working directory**  that were not in our last snapshot (**commit**) and are not in our  **staging area**.

# How to Create a Repo — The Conventional Way

Let’s make sure that we understand how the terms we’ve introduced relate to the process of creating a  **repository**. This is just a quick high-level view, before we dive much deeper into this process.

Note — most posts with shell commands show UNIX commands. I will provide commands for both Windows and UNIX, with screenshots from Windows, for the sake of variance. When the commands are exactly the same, I will provide them only once.

We will initialize a new  **repository** using  `git init repo_1`, and then change our directory to that of the repository using  `cd repo_1`. By using  `tree /f .git`  we can see that running  `git init`  resulted in quite a few sub-directories inside  `.git`. (The flag  `/f`  includes files in  `tree`’s output).

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-51.png)

Let's create a file inside the  `repo_1`  directory:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-52.png)

On a Linux system:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-53.png)

This file is within our  **working directory**. Yet, since we haven’t added it to the  **staging area**, it is currently  **untracked**. Let's verify using  `git status`:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-54.png)

The new file is untracked as we haven’t added it to the staging area, and it wasn’t included in a previous commit

We can now add this file to the  **staging area**  by using  `git add new_file.txt`. We can verify that it has been staged by running  `git status`:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-55.png)

Adding the new file to the staging area

We can now create a  **commit**  using  `git commit`:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-56.png)

Has something changed within  `.git`  directory? Let’s run  `tree /f .git`  to check:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-57.png)

A lot of things have changed within \`.git\`

Apparently, quite a lot has changed. It's time to dive deeper into the structure of  `.git`  and understand what is going on under the hood when we run  `git init`,  `git add`  or  `git commit`.

# Time to get hard core

So far we've covered some Git fundamentals, and now we’re ready to really  __Git going.__

In order to deeply understand how  `git`  works, we will create a  ****repository****, but this time — we'll build it from scratch.

We won’t use  `git init`,  `git add`  or  `git commit`  which will enable us to get a better hands-on understanding of the process.

# How to Set Up  `.git`

Let’s create a new directory, and run  `git status`  within it:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-106.png)

Alright, so  `git`  seems unhappy as we don’t have a  `.git`  folder. The natural thing to do would be to simply create that directory:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-107.png)

Apparently, creating a  `.git`  directory is just not enough. We need to add some content to that directory.

****A****  ****git repository has two** main  **components****:

1.  A collection of objects —  ****blobs****,  ****trees,****  and  ****commits****.
2.  A system of naming those objects — called  ****references****.

A  ****repository****  may also contain other things, such as git hooks, but at the very least — it must include objects and references.

Let’s create a directory for the objects at  `.git\objects`  and a directory for the references (in short:  ****refs****) at  `.git\refs`  (on UNIX -based systems —  `.git/objects`  and  `.git/refs`, respectively).

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-108.png)

One type of reference is  ****branches****. Internally,  `git`  calls  ****branches**** by the name  ****heads****. So we will create a directory for them —  `.git\refs\heads`.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-109.png)

This still doesn’t change our  `git status`:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-110.png)

How does  `git`  know where to start when looking for a  ****commit****  in the  ****repository****? As I explained earlier, it looks for  `HEAD`, which points to the current active branch (or  ****commit****, in some cases).

So, we need to create the  `HEAD`, which is just a file residing at  `.git\HEAD`. We can apply the following:

On Windows:  `> echo ref: refs/heads/master > .git\HEAD`

On UNIX:  `$ echo "ref: refs/heads/master" > .git/HEAD`

⭐ So we now know how  `HEAD`  is implemented — it’s simply a file, and its contents describe what it points to.

Following the command above,  `git status`  seems to change its mind:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-111.png)

HEAD is just a file

Notice that  `git`  believes we are on a branch called  `master`, even though we haven’t created this branch. As mentioned before,  `master`  is just a name. We could also make  `git`  believe we are on a branch called  `banana`  if we wanted to:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-112.png)

🍌

We will switch back to  `master`  for the rest of this post, just to adhere to the normal convention.

Now that we have our  `.git`  directory ready, can we work our way to make a  ****commit****  (again, without using  `git add`  or  `git commit`).

# Plumbing vs Porcelain Commands in Git

At this point, it would be helpful to make a distinction between two types of  `git`  commands:  ****plumbing**** and  ****porcelain****. The application of the terms oddly comes from toilets (yeah, these — 🚽), traditionally made of porcelain, and the infrastructure of plumbing (pipes and drains).

We can say that the porcelain layer provides a user-friendly interface to the plumbing. Most people only deal with the porcelain. Yet, when things go (terribly) wrong, and someone wants to understand why, they would have to roll-up their sleeves to check the plumbing. (Note: these terms are not mine, they are used very widely in  `git`).

`git`  uses this terminology as an analogy to separate the low-level commands that users don’t usually need to use directly (“plumbing” commands) from the more user-friendly high level commands (“porcelain” commands).

So far, we have dealt with porcelain commands —  `git init`,  `git add`  or  `git commit`. Next, we transition to plumbing commands.

# How to Create Objects in Git

Let's start with creating an object and writing it into the objects’ database of  `git`, residing within  `.git\objects`. We'll find the SHA-1 hash value of a  ****blob****  by using our first plumbing command,  `git hash-object`, in the following way:

On Windows:

`> echo git is awesome | git hash-object --stdin`

On UNIX:

`$ echo "git is awesome" | git hash-object --stdin`

By using  `--stdin`  we are instructing  `git hash-object`  to take its input from the standard input. This will provide us with the relevant hash value.

In order to actually write that  ****blob****  into  `git`’s object database, we can simply add the  `-w`  switch for  `git hash-object`. Then, we can check the contents of the  `.git`  folder, and see that they have changed.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-113.png)

Writing a blob to the objects’ database

We can now see that the hash of our  ****blob****  is —  `54f6...36`. We can also see that a directory has been created under  `.git\objects`, a directory named  `54`, and within it, a file by the name of  `f6...36`.

So  `git`  actually takes the first two characters of the SHA-1 hash and uses them as the name of a directory. The remaining characters are used as the filename for the file that actually contains the  ****blob****.

Why is that so? Consider a fairly big repository, one that has 300,000 objects (****blobs****,  ****trees****, and  ****commits****) in its database. To look up a hash inside that list of 300,000 hashes can take a while. Thus,  `git`  simply divides that problem by 256.

To look up the hash above,  `git`  would first look for the directory named  `54`  inside the directory  `.git\objects`, which may have up to 256 directories (`00`  through  `FF`). Then, it will search that directory, narrowing down the search as it goes.

Back to our process of generating a  ****commit****. We have now created an object. What is the type of that object? We can use another plumbing command,  `git cat-file -t`  (`-t`  stands for “type”), to check that out:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-114.png)

Not surprisingly, this object is a  ****blob****. We can also use  `git cat-file -p`  (`-p`  stands for “pretty-print”) to see its contents:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-115.png)

This process of creating a  ****blob**** usually happens when we add something to the  ****staging area**** — that is, when we use  `git add`.

Remember that  `git`  creates a  ****blob****  of the  __entire__  file that is staged. Even if a single character is modified or added (as we added  `!`  in our example before), the file has a new  ****blob**** with a new  ****hash****.

Will there be any change to  `git status`?

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-116.png)

Apparently, no. Adding a  ****blob****  object to  `git`’s internal database doesn’t change the status, as  `git`  doesn’t know of any tracked or untracked files at this stage.

We need to track this file — add it to the  ****staging area****. To do that, we can use the plumbing command  `git update-index`, like so:  `git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 <blob-hash> <filename>`.

Note: (The  `cacheinfo`  is a 16-bit file mode  [as stored by git][3], following the layout of  [POSIX types and modes][4]. This is not within the scope of this post).

Running the command above will result in a change to  `.git`'s contents:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-117.png)

Can you spot the change? A new file by the name of  `index`  was created. This is it — the famous  ****index****  (or  ****staging area****), is basically a file that resides within  `.git\index`.

So now that our  ****blob****  has been added to the  ****index****, we expect  `git status`  to look different, like this:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-118.png)

That’s interesting! Two things happened here.

First, we can see that  `new_file.txt`  appears in green, in the  `Changes to be committed`  area. That is so because the  ****index****  now has  `new_file.txt`, waiting to be committed.

Second, we can see that  `new_file.txt`  appears in red — because  `git`  believes the  __file__  `my_file.txt`  has been deleted, and the fact that the file has been deleted is not staged.

This happens as we added the  ****blob****  with the contents  `git is awesome`  to the objects’ database, and told the  ****index****  that the file  `my_file.txt`  has the contents of that  ****blob****, but we never actually created that file.

We can easily solve this by taking the contents of the  ****blob****, and writing them to our file system, to a file called  `my_file.txt`:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-119.png)

As a result, it will no longer appear in red by  `git status`:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-120.png)

So now it’s time to create a  ****commit****  object from our  ****staging area****. As explained above, a  ****commit****  object has a reference to a  ****tree****, so we need to create a  ****tree****.

We can do this with the command  `git write-tree`, which records the contents of the  ****index****  in a  ****tree****  object. Of course, we can use  `git cat-file -t`  to see that it’s indeed a  ****tree:****

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-121.png)

Creating a tree object of the index

And we can use  `git cat-file -p`  to see its contents:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-122.png)

Great, so we created a  ****tree****, and now we need to create a  ****commit****  object that references this  ****tree****. To do that, we can use  `git commit-tree <tree-hash> -m <commit message>`:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-123.png)

You should now feel comfortable with the commands used to check the created object’s type, and print its contents:

Creating a commit object

Note that this  ****commit**** doesn’t have a  ****parent****, because it’s the first  ****commit****. When we add another  ****commit****  we will have to declare its  ****parent**** — we will do so later.

The last hash that we got —  `80e...8f`  – is a  ****commit****’s hash. We are actually very used to using these hashes — we look at them all the time. Note that this  ****commit**** owns a  ****tree**** object, with its own hash, which we rarely specify explicitly.

Will something change in  `git status`?

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-125.png)

Nope 🤔.

Why is that? Well, to know that our file has been committed,  `git`  needs to know about the latest  ****commit****. How does  `git`  do that? It goes to the  `HEAD`:

Looking at \`HEAD\` on Windows

Looking at \`HEAD\` on UNIX

`HEAD`  points to  `master`, but what is  `master`? We haven’t really created it yet.

As we explained earlier in this post, a branch is simply a named reference to a  ****commit****. And in this case, we would like  `master`  to refer to the  ****commit****  with the hash  `80e8ed4fb0bfc3e7ba88ec417ecf2f6e6324998f`.

We can achieve this by simply creating a file at  `\refs\heads\master`, with the contents of this hash, like so:

⭐ In sum, a  ****branch****  is just a file inside  `.git\refs\heads`, containing a hash of the  ****commit**** it refers to.

Now, finally,  `git status`  and  `git log`  seem to appreciate our efforts:

We have successfully created a  ****commit**** without using porcelain commands! How cool is that? 🎉

# How to Work with Branches in Git — Under the Hood

Just as we’ve created a  ****repository****  and a  ****commit**** without using  `git init`,  `git add`  or  `git commit`, now we will create and switch between  ****branches****  without using porcelain commands (`git branch`  or  `git checkout`).

It’s perfectly understandable if you are excited, I am too 🙂

****Let’s start:****

So far we only have one  ****branch****,  named  `master`. To create another one with the name  `test`  (as the equivalent of  `git branch test`), we would need to simply create a file named  `test`  within  `.git\refs\heads`, and the contents of that file would be the same  ****commit****’s hash as the  `master`  points to.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-130.png)

If we use  `git log`, we can see that this is indeed the case — both  `master`  and  `test`  point to this  ****commit****:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-131.png)

Let’s also switch to our newly created branch (the equivalent of  `git checkout test`). For that, we should change  `HEAD`  to point to our new branch:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-132.png)

Switching to branch \`test\` by changing \`HEAD\`

As we can see, both  `git status`  and  `git log`  confirm that  `HEAD`  now points to  `test`, which is, therefore, the active branch.

We can now use the commands we have already used to create another file and add it to the index:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-133.png)

Using the commands above, we have created a file named  `test.txt`, with the content of  `Testing`, created a corresponding  ****blob,**** and added it to the ****index****. We also created a  ****tree****  representing the  ****index****.

It’s now time to create a  ****commit****  referencing this  ****tree****. This time, we should also specify the  __parent__  of this  ****commit****  — which would be the previous  ****commit****. We specify the parent using the  `-p`  switch of  `git commit-tree`:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-136.png)

We have just created a  ****commit****, with a  ****tree****  as well as a parent, as we can see:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-139.png)

Will  `git log`  show us the new  ****commit****?

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-138.png)

As we can see,  `git log`  doesn’t show anything new. Why is that? 🤔 Remember that  `git log`  traces the  ****branches****  to find relevant commits to show. It shows us now  `test`  and the  ****commit****  it points to, and it also shows  `master`  which points to the same  ****commit****.

That’s right — we need to change  `test`  to point to our new  ****commit****. We can do that by simply changing the contents of  `.git\refs\heads\test`:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-140.png)

It worked! 🎉🥂

`git log`  goes to  `HEAD`, which tells it to go to the branch  `test`, which points to  ****commit****  `465...5e`, which links back to its parent  ****commit****  `80e...8f`.

Feel free to admire the beauty, we  __git__ you. 😊

# Summary

This post introduced you to the internals of  `git`. We started by covering the basic objects — **blobs**,  **trees,** and  **commits**.

We learned that a  **blob**  holds the contents of a file. A  **tree**  is a directory-listing, containing  **blobs**  and/or sub-**trees**. A  **commit**  is a snapshot of our working directory, with some meta-data such as the time or the commit message.

We then discussed  **branches** and explained that they are nothing but a named reference to a  **commit**.

We went on to describe the  **working directory**, a directory that has a repository associated with it, the  **staging area (index)**  which holds the  **tree** for the next  **commit**, and the  **repository**, which is a collection of  **commits**.

We clarified how these terms relate to  `git`  commands we know by creating a new repository and committing a file using the well-known  `git init`,  `git add`, and  `git commit`.

Then, we fearlessly deep-dived into  `git`. We stopped using porcelain commands and switched to plumbing commands.

By using  `echo`  and low-level commands such as  `git hash-object`, we were able to create a  ****blob****, add it to the  ****index****, create a  ****tree****  of the  ****index****, and create a  ****commit**** object pointing to that  ****tree****.

We were also able to create and switch between  ****branches****. Kudos to those of you who tried this on their own!👏

Hopefully, after following this post you feel you’ve deepened your understanding of what is happening under the hood when working with  `git`.
